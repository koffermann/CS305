# CS305: Software Security

<br> <b><i>Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address? </b></i>
<br> Artemis Financial is a financial consulting firm that creates financial plans for their customers. These financial plans can range from savings to insurance. The issue that Artemis Financial has is that the public web application that they are creating is not as secure as they would like it to be. It is their goal to when data is transferred from one endpoint to another that there are measures in place to ensure that the connection is secure and that the application is able to verify through data verification like checksum that the data is arriving at its intended location. Artemis Financial reached out to Global Rain to create these security measures.
<br>
<br> <b><i>What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?</b></i>
<br> One thing (I hope) I did particularly well in identifying Artemis Financial's software security vulnerabilities was examining their base codes and spotting errors that could lead to a possible security breech in the future. For example, pinpointing areas in the code where a hacker would be able to inject malicious code or intercept a connection between client and server. It is important to code securely because often times the only barrier between a company's private information and those that wish to access it is reliable coding. The value that software security adds to a company's overall wellbeing, first and foremost, a reliable defense against costly damage that could be done by attackers. If, for example, an attacker manages to steal private information from customers and leak it online, the customers can create a lawsuit against the company itself for not taking proper measures to protect their data. Security is also a great feature in marketing to customers themselves. A company can attract more customers towards their application (and thus business) by offering proof that they are reliable when it comes to protecting data.
<br>
<br> What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
<br>
<br> How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
<br>
<br> How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
<br>
<br> What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
<br>
<br> Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
